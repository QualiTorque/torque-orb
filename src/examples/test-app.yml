  This example demonstrates how you can build and test your app using Torque Orb.
  First build app and publish it to s3 bucket. Than deploy Torque Sandbox
  with your new application as an artifact parameter and do some testing against the endpoint
  of your deployed application.
usage:
  version: 2.1
  
  orbs:
    colony: quali/torque@1.0
    aws-s3: circleci/aws-s3@1.0.11
  jobs:
    build-and-publish:
      docker:
        - image: circleci/ruby:2.4.1
      steps:
        - checkout
        - run:
            name: Archive app
            command: |
              mkdir -p workspace
              tar -zcf my-webapp.latest.tar.gz -C my_app/ .
        - aws-s3/copy:
            from: my-webapp.latest.tar.gz
            to: "s3://my-webapp-artifacts/latest/"
  workflows:
    leadeasy:
      jobs:
        - build-and-publish
        - colony/sandbox:
            name: Test Application
            sandbox-name: "test-sandbox"
            blueprint: "my-web-application"
            inputs: "{'AWS_INSTANCE_TYPE': 'm5.large'}"
            artifacts: "{'webapp-frontend':'latest/my-webapp.latest.tar.gz'}"
            steps:
              - run: echo "Do some testing here"
              - run:
                  command: |
                    echo "Getting application endpoint"
                    SB_ENDPOINT="SB_${SANDBOX_ID}_SHORTCUT_1"
                    echo "Checking ${!SB_ENDPOINT}"
                    curl --write-out "%{http_code}\n" --silent --output /dev/null "${!SB_ENDPOINT}" 
            requires:
              - build-and-publish
